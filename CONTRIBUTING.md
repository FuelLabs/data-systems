# Contributing

This guide will show you how to run this project locally if you want to test
or contribute to it.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Most projects under the umbrella of data systems are written in Rust, so we
prefer using Rust tooling and community standards. Ensure you have the
following tools installed:

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
-   [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## üìü Setting up

First, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fuellabs/data-systems.git
cd data-systems
```

Now, install the necessary tools to ensure code quality and standards. Use
Make to simplify this process:

```sh
make setup
```

You can check the [./scripts/setup.sh](./scripts/setup.sh) file to see what is
being installed on your machine.

## üìù Code conventions

We enforce some conventions to ensure code quality, sustainability, and
maintainability. The following tools help us with that:

-   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) -
    Ensures that commit messages are clear and understandable.
-   [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - Ensures that the code is formatted
    and linted before being committed.

### Writing your commits

When creating a commit, please follow the [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Use
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message with one of the
following categories:

-   `feat`: All changes that introduce completely new code or new
    features.
-   `fix`: Changes that fix a bug (ideally referencing an issue if present).
-   `refactor`: Any code-related change that is not a fix or a feature.
-   `docs`: Changes to existing documentation or creation of new documentation
    (e.g., README, usage docs).
-   `build`: Changes regarding the build of the software, dependencies, or the
    addition of new dependencies.
-   `test`: Changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
    ones).
-   `ci`: Changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (e.g.,
    GitHub Actions, CI systems).
-   `chore`: Changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
    categories.
