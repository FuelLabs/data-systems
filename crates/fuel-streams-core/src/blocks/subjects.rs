/// Represents a NATS subject for blocks in the Fuel network.
///
/// This subject format allows for efficient querying and filtering of blocks
/// based on their producer and height.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Creating a subject for a specific block:
///
/// ```
/// # use fuel_streams_core::blocks::BlocksSubject;
/// # use fuel_streams_core::prelude::*;
/// # use fuel_streams_macros::subject::IntoSubject;
/// let subject = BlocksSubject {
///     producer: Some(Address::zeroed()),
///     height: Some(23.into()),
/// };
/// assert_eq!(subject.parse(), "blocks.0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.23");
/// ```
///
/// All blocks wildcard:
///
/// ```
/// # use fuel_streams_core::blocks::BlocksSubject;
/// assert_eq!(BlocksSubject::WILDCARD, "blocks.>");
/// ```
///
/// Creating a subject query using the `wildcard` method for flexible parameter-based filtering
///
/// ```
/// # use fuel_streams_core::blocks::BlocksSubject;
/// # use fuel_streams_core::prelude::*;
/// let wildcard = BlocksSubject::wildcard(None, Some(23.into()));
/// assert_eq!(wildcard, "blocks.*.23");
/// ```
///
/// Using the builder pattern for flexible subject construction:
/// This approach allows for step-by-step creation of a `BlocksSubject`,
///
/// ```
/// # use fuel_streams_core::blocks::BlocksSubject;
/// # use fuel_streams_core::prelude::*;
/// # use fuel_streams_macros::subject::*;
/// let subject = BlocksSubject::new()
///     .with_producer(Some(Address::zeroed()))
///     .with_height(Some(23.into()));
/// assert_eq!(subject.parse(), "blocks.0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.23");
